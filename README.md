# PM2-Replacement
I hate PM2. Time to improve it and create a better debugger with better features that also runs any type of process.


Add executable file path for now (NOT PERMENANT)
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/executable/directory

PERMENANT
1. open nvim ~/.zshrc
2. export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/executable/directory
3. source ~/.zshrc
4. Run TM to check

CREATE Bash script for this.
